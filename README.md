Business Problem

In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each
hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and
less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotels'
primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to
offer thorough business advice to address this problem.
The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing
on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of this report.

Analysis and Findings

The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are canceled
and those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of
reservations that have not been canceled. There are still 37% of clients who canceled
their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotels' earnings.

In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It's possible that resort
hotels are more expensive than those in cities.

The line graph above shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel
is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without
saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and
lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the
number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations are largest
in the month of August. whereas January is the month with the most canceled
reservations.

This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are
greatest and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the
accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation.
Now, let's see which country has the highest reservation canceled. The top country is
Portugal with the highest number of cancellations.

Letâ€™s check the area from where guests are visiting the hotels and making reservations.
Is it coming from Direct or Groups, Online or Offline Travel Agents? Around 46% of the
clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of
clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

As seen in the graph, reservations are canceled when the average daily rate is higher
than when it is not canceled. It clearly proves all the above analysis, that the higher
price leads to higher cancellation.

Suggestions

1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of
reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the
rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some
discounts to the consumers.
2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in
the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable
discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a
reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in
this month.
4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in
Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
